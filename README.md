# Network-slicing-for-smart-city-IOT-services
This project demonstrates Network Slicing, a key 5G technology that allows a telecom network to be divided into isolated “slices.” Each slice supports a specific IoT service—CCTV, traffic lights, pollution sensors, smart lights, etc.—with customized QoS (Quality of Service).
